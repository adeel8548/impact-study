## Voucher Features

### Auto-Generated Fields

| Field | How It Works |
|-------|-------------|
| **Serial Number** | Automatically incremented (1, 2, 3...) |
| **Issue Date** | Set to today's date |
| **Due Date** | Always 12th of current month |
| **Monthly Fee** | Current month's unpaid fee |
| **Arrears** | Sum of all previous unpaid months |
| **Fines** | Rs. 20 × (today - 12th) if past 12th |
| **Total Amount** | Monthly Fee + Arrears + Fines |

### Fine Calculation

```
Rule: Rs. 20 per day after 12th of month

Examples:
- On 12th: Fine = 0
- On 13th: Fine = 20 Rs
- On 20th: Fine = 8 × 20 = 160 Rs
- On 25th: Fine = 13 × 20 = 260 Rs
```

### Arrears Separation

The system automatically separates fees:
- **Current Month** → Shows as "Monthly Fee"
- **Previous Months** → Shows as "Arrears"

Example:
```
Student has unpaid:
- January: 500
- February: 500
- March (current): 500

Voucher shows:
Monthly Fee: 500
Arrears: 1000
Total: 1500
```

## Customization Options

### Change Fine Amount (Rs. 20)

Edit: `lib/actions/fee-vouchers.ts`

```typescript
// Line 45 - Change this value:
const FINE_PER_DAY = 20;  // ← Change 20 to your amount
```

### Change Due Date (12th)

Edit: `lib/actions/fee-vouchers.ts`

```typescript
// Line 68 - Change 12 to your date:
const dueDate = new Date(currentYear, currentMonth - 1, 12);
                                                        ↑
                                                    Change this
```

### Change Voucher Design

Edit: `components/fee-voucher.tsx`

You can customize:
- Colors
- Font sizes
- Layout
- Logo (currently shows "ISI")
- Footer text in Urdu

## Troubleshooting

### Q: Serial numbers not incrementing?
**A**: 
1. Check if `fee_vouchers` table exists
2. Verify table has data with `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fee_vouchers;`
3. If empty, that's OK - it starts from 1

### Q: Arrears showing as 0?
**A**: 
1. Ensure student has previous unpaid fees
2. Check `student_fees` table has correct month/year
3. Verify fee status is "unpaid"

### Q: Fine showing as 0?
**A**: 
1. Check if today is after 12th of month
2. Verify system date/time is correct
3. If before 12th, fine will be 0 (correct behavior)

### Q: Print button not working?
**A**:
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Allow browser to show print dialog
3. Check if `react-to-print` is installed: `npm list react-to-print`
4. Try a different browser

### Q: Voucher looks wrong?
**A**:
1. Try printing as PDF (in print dialog)
2. Adjust browser zoom (Ctrl+0 for default)
3. Check if CSS is loading properly
