## Known Limitations

1. **Large Batch Printing**
   - Printing > 500 students may be slow
   - Recommendation: Print in batches of 100

2. **Browser Support**
   - IE 11: Not supported
   - Modern browsers: Full support
   - Mobile: Limited print support

3. **Fine Calculation**
   - Assumes consistent server date
   - Doesn't handle date changes mid-print
   - Resets at midnight

4. **Concurrent Users**
   - Multiple admins can print simultaneously
   - Serial numbers may skip in high-concurrency
   - Rare edge case, acceptable
