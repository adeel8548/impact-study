## 🎓 Learning Resources

### Firestore Operations

- `subscribeToAdminConversations()` - Get admin's conversations in real-time
- `subscribeToTeacherConversations()` - Get teacher's conversations in real-time
- `subscribeToMessages()` - Get messages in a conversation in real-time
- `broadcastMessage()` - Send message to multiple teachers

### Component Usage

```typescript
import { ChatWindow } from "@/components/chat/ChatWindow";

<ChatWindow
  conversationId="conv-123"
  currentUserId="user-id"
  currentUserName="Admin"
/>
```

### Hook Usage

```typescript
import { subscribeToAdminConversations } from "@/lib/firestore-helpers";

useEffect(() => {
  const unsub = subscribeToAdminConversations(adminId, (conversations) => {
    setConversations(conversations);
  });
  return () => unsub();
}, [adminId]);
```

## 🔐 Security Highlights

### Read Access

- ✅ Only conversation participants can read messages
- ✅ Users can only read their own conversations
- ✅ Admins cannot read other admins' conversations

### Write Access

- ✅ Only message sender can create messages
- ✅ Only conversation participants can update messages
- ✅ Users cannot create conversations they're not in

### Data Privacy

- ✅ No cross-teacher message visibility
- ✅ Broadcast messages stored separately (each gets own conversation)
- ✅ Read status only updated by message recipient
